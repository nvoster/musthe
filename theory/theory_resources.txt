Here are some pretty solid online theory tools. There are probably several different ways to use them, but I would prefer not
directly interacting with them - that would make for unnecessary maintenance and dependency.


I will also be reading through Vincent Persichetti's "Twentieth Century Harmony" and Dariusz Terefenko's "Jazz Theory: from Basic to
Advanced Study" - as I come across interesting theoretical or compositional concepts I will try to add them to the code (likely as
separate files to distinguish them from the general theory).

0. scale library, chord library

1. Analyze a scale
  Choose any scale and find all the chords that fit in the scale. See all the modes of the scale and the corresponding
  chordal harmony stacked in thirds.

2. All scales containing a chord
  Choose any chord and calculate all the scales with all roots in which the chord exists.

3. Compare chords in two scales.
  Choose any two scales to find the common chords and notes, and the uncommon chords and notes. This will facilitate
  changing between keys and scales. Changes can be made smooth using the common chords and established using uncommon chords.

4. Scales containing two chords
  Choose any two chords and find all the scales that contain both.

5. Chord progressions in any key
  Choose any tonic note and the key type, major or minor. The program will show a collected list of chord progressions in the chosen key.
